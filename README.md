Titanic Survival Prediction Project

Overview

This project aims to predict the likelihood of survival for passengers aboard the Titanic using data analysis and machine learning techniques. The dataset is sourced from the Kaggle Titanic competition, which provides passenger data, including attributes like age, sex, ticket class, and more.

Project Features

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA): Visualizations and insights into the dataset to uncover survival patterns.

Feature Engineering: Creation of meaningful features such as family size, title extraction, and cabin prefixes.

Model Building: Training machine learning models to predict survival probabilities.

Evaluation: Assessing model performance using metrics like accuracy
